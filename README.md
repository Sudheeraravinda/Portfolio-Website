Welcome to my personal portfolio website, a fully responsive and visually appealing project built using only HTML and CSS to showcase my skills, experience, and creative work. This portfolio is designed to provide a seamless and engaging user experience, featuring a well-structured layout with dedicated sections for an about page, project showcase, and contact form. Using semantic HTML5, the website ensures better accessibility and SEO, while CSS3 brings life to the design with custom styles, smooth animations, hover effects, and media queries for responsiveness across all devices. The project is lightweight and optimized for fast loading without relying on frameworks or JavaScript, ensuring simplicity and efficiency. The file structure is clean and organized, making it easy to navigate and modify, with separate stylesheets for main design elements and responsive adjustments. To view the portfolio locally, clone the repository from GitHub, navigate to the project folder, and open index.html in your browser. Alternatively, a live demo is available for a quick preview. Whether you're interested in collaborating, sharing feedback, or just exploring my work, feel free to reach out via [your contact details], and let's connect!
